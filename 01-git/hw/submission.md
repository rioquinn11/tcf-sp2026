I think git will be useful if I am ever working on a software project with people in the future. If I have to work with a bunch of people on a team it would be needed to see changes. Also even for personal projects especially ones that I forget out for a year and then go back to it would be very helpful in terms of figuring out what code does what and what I was thinking when I wrote the code.
