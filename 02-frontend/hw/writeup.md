In this homework I learned how the structure the website. First I learned the layout flex sturcture of how things are styled in terms of rows versus columns. I experimented with this using the VScode built in AI and tried different background colors. Then I played with the margins and figured out how they work. I added in the hyperlinks of my linkedin insta and github as images that you can click on and it takes you directly to my pages. I also added in a bio and played with the margins on that. I figured out that if I add a marginBottom below the text it adds more whitespace on the page so I can scroll down which makes the page a little easier to look rather than being frozen in space. I also changed the favicon.ico to the tamid logo and renamed the website tab title.

Because its react rather than pure HTML, everything is able to be seperated into its own files like page.tsx and layout.tsx rather than being one file. This makes it easier to understand and code.

I'm not entirely sure how TS, Tailwind and next.js are all working together but from what I understand that is that the typescript is what I am writing in and the next.js is what actually deploys everything as the format off the website. Tailwind I believe is what I'm using when I do style={{}} and that provides things like margins and background color and rows vs colors and spacing patterns
